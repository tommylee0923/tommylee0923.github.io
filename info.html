                <p>
                    I am a multidisciplinary individual with a robust foundation in civil engineering and a passion for
                    architectural design and technology. Currently pursuing a Master of Architecture at Yale School of
                    Architecture, I blend technical proficiency with creative design solutions.

                <p>
                    My expertise spans a wide array of tools and technologies, including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Design Software</strong>: Proficient in AutoCAD, Rhino 3D, Revit, Grasshopper, and
                        ArchiCAD, I create detailed and innovative designs. My experience with Adobe Suite, Bluebeam,
                        and SketchUp further supports my ability to deliver comprehensive design presentations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Visualization and Rendering</strong>: Skilled in V-Ray, Enscape, and Unreal Engine 5, I
                        bring designs to life with immersive visualizations and high-quality renderings.</li>
                    <li><strong>GIS and Data Analysis</strong>: Utilizing ArcGIS, I incorporate spatial analysis and
                        geographic data into my projects, enhancing the depth and context of my designs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Programming and Development</strong>: With a strong background in Python, C, C#, Java,
                        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I develop custom computational tools and interactive web
                        applications, seamlessly integrating technology into architectural workflows.</li>
                    <li><strong>AI and Emerging Technologies</strong>: Leveraging tools like Stable Diffusion, I explore
                        the intersection of artificial intelligence and design, pushing the boundaries of creative
                        innovation.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Through my diverse skill set, I aim to bridge the gap between traditional design principles and
                    modern technological advancements, crafting solutions that are both aesthetically pleasing and
                    functionally robust.
